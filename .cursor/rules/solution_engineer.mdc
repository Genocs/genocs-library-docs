# Documentation Library Best Practices and Writing Styles

This document outlines the recommended best practices for writing technical documentation. It covers various aspects including writing style, topic organization, and tooling to ensure robust, scalable, and secure solutions.

## 1. Topic Organization and Structure

A well-organized set of topic s crucial for comprehansion, and collaboration. The following guidelines provide a structured approach to organizing your Documentation projects.

### Directory Structure Best Practices

Adopt a modular and logical directory structure based on the application's architecture and components.

*   **`devops/`**: Contains the source code of Azure DevOps pipelines for your application.
    *   **`azure/`**: Contains the source code of Azure DevOps pipelines for your application.
*   **`infrastructure/`**: Contains the source code of IaC and platform setup scripts for your application.
    *   **`bicep/`**: Contains the source code of Bicep templates for your application.
    *   **`terraform/`**: Contains the source code of Terraform templates for your application.
*   **`scripts/`**: Automation scripts for deployment, build processes, etc.
*   **`src/`**: Contains the source code of your application.


Example:

root-project/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
├── .git/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
├── devops/
│   └── azure/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── bicep/
│   └── terraform/
├── scripts/
├── src/
├── .gitignore
├── .editorconfig
├── Directory.Build.props
├── Directory.Build.targets
├── dotnet.ruleset
├── global.json
├── stylecop.json
├── nuget.config
├── project.sln
└── README.md


### File Naming Conventions

Maintain consistency in file naming to improve readability and searchability.

*   Use descriptive names that reflect the file's purpose.
*   Use a consistent case (e.g., camelCase or kebab-case).
*   Use appropriate file extensions (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.tf`, `.bicep`).
*   For React components, use `ComponentName.jsx` or `ComponentName.tsx`.

Example:

*   `user-service.js` (for a user service module)
*   `UserProfile.jsx` (for a user profile component)
*   `storage-account.tf` (for a Terraform file defining a storage account)

### Module Organization

Divide the application into independent and reusable modules based on functionality.

*   Each module should have a clear responsibility and a well-defined interface.
*   Minimize dependencies between modules to promote loose coupling.
*   Consider using a module bundler (e.g., Webpack, Parcel) to manage dependencies and optimize the build process.

Example:

A `user-management` module could contain components and services related to user authentication, authorization, and profile management.


By following these best practices, you can build robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable Azure applications.
