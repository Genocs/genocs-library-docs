## Goals

The goal of this repository is to help developers / companies kickstart their Web Application Development with a pre-built Blazor WebAssembly Boilerplate that includes several much needed components and features.

> Note that this is a frontend / client application only! The backend for this application is available in a seperate repository.
> - Find Genocs Library's .NET 7 Web API Boilerplate here - https://github.com/Genocs/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate

## Prerequisites
