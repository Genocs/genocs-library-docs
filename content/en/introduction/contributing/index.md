## How to contribute?

Please note the following steps are applicable only for the `genocs-library-docs` repository.

1. Fork the `genocs-library-docs` repository to your Github profile.
2. `[Optional]` Navigate to your newly forked Repository -> Settings -> Secrets.
3. `[Optional]` Add a new Repository Secret with a name `GT_TOKEN`. As for the value, paste in your GitHub Token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)
4. Clone this repository locally.
5. Ensure that you have Node.js and Visual Code installed.
6. At the root of the repository run `npm install`. This installs all the required packages. Might take some time depending on your network connection.
7. All the documentations are to be written in markdown format.
8. Refer `https://github.com/Genocs/genocs-library-docs/blob/main/content/en/dotnet-templates/general/getting-started/index.md` to get an idea on how to write documentation and include images, code snippets and stuff.
9. To run the application locally, run the command `npm run start` and navigate to **localhost:1313**
