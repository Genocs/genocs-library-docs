## Installation

``` bash
dotnet add package Genocs.Tracing
```

> **Open Tracing migration to Open Telemetry**
>
> We are committed to move forward from former Open Tracing to the [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
>

## Dependencies

- Genocs.Core
- Open Tracing

Genocs Library does not generate any default spans for your ASP.NET Core applications. However, this can be simply achieved by plugging in Open Tracing.

## Installation


## Usage

Inside your *Program.cs* extend `IGenocsBuilder` with `AddOpenTelemetry()` then `AddJaeger()` that will create the `ITracer` using chosen sampler and reporter:

``` cs

var builder = services
                    .AddGenocs()
                    .AddOpenTelemetry()
                    .AddJaeger();

//other registrations    
return builder.Build();
```

### Jaeger

Once your application produces spans needed for Jaeger, you need to enable reporting in a way that suits you the most.

### Creating custom spans

Once the `ITracer` got registered in Startup.cs file, you can inject it to any class you want to create custom spans (not provided by Open Tracing) as follows:

``` cs
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly ITracer _tracer;

    public MyClass(ITracer tracer)
    {
        _tracer = tracer;
    }

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        using(var scope = BuildScope())
        {
            var span = scope.Span;

            try
            {
                span.Log("Starting the execution of the code");
                ///some code
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                span.Log(ex.Message);
                span.SetTag(Tags.Error, true);
            }
        }
    }

    private IScope BuildScope()
        => _tracer
            .BuildSpan("Executing important code")
            .StartActive(true);
}
```

## Options

`enabled` - determines whether reporting is enabled.

`serviceName` - name of the applciation thatâ€™s going to be used in Jaeger query engine.

`udpHost` - host part of the Jaeger endpoint (UDP).

`udpPort` - port of the Jaeger endpoint (UDP).

`maxPacketSize` - maximum size of the UDP header packet (by default 0). This is not required.

`sampler` - The allowed values are: const, rate and probabilistic. For more details about sampling check the official Jaeger Docs.

`maxTracesPerSecond` - determines maximum number of reported traces per second. Required only for rate sampler.

`samplingRate` - determines the percentage of spans to report. Required only for probabilistic sampler.

## Settings

Following settings are required to be set in your **appsettings.json**

``` json
"jaeger": {
  "enabled": true,
  "serviceName": "users",
  "udpHost": "localhost",
  "udpPort": 6831,
  "maxPacketSize": 65000,
  "sampler": "const",
  "maxTracesPerSecond": 10,
  "excludePaths": ["/", "/ping", "/metrics"]
}
```
