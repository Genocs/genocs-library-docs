## What's Genocs's .NET Multitenancy Template?

Github Repository URI : [Genocs/dotnet-multitenancy-template](https://github.com/Genocs/microservice-template)


The template can be used with the `genocs cli`, `dotnet new` command or with the `Visual Studio 2022`, `Visual Studio Code` IDEs.


## Goals

The goal of this templete is to provide a complete and feature-rich starting point for any .NET Developer/Team to kick-start their next major project using .NET Microservices architecture. This also serves the purpose of learning advanced concepts and implementations such as `Multitenancy, CQRS, Onion Architecture, Clean Coding standards, Docker Concepts, Cloud Deployments with Terraform to AWS, CI/CD Pipelines & Workflows` and so on.
