Refer Development Environment for details.
This guide will take you right from strating up your own .NET Web API Project using Genocs Library .NET WebAPI Boilerplate package / repository to testing the API using the provided Postman/ThunderClient Collection!
To get started with this Boilerplate, here are the available options.
Install using the Genocs CLI tool.</description></item><item><title>API Testing</title><link>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/api-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 15:51:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/api-testing/</guid><description>Genocs&amp;rsquo;s Web API can be tested via ThunderClient, Postman as well as the built in Swagger.
Once the WebAPI is up and running (by default of port 5001 of localhost), here are the ways to test the functionalilty easily.
Swagger # Navigate to https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html
Here you can see all the available endpoints. Since all of the endpoints except the login and registration endpoints are secured, you would need a Authentication Token to access these services.</description></item><item><title>MakeFile Commands</title><link>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/makefile-commands/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 10:23:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/makefile-commands/</guid><description>Makefile is included within this solution to give a better developer experience. Here are the makefile commands available for this solution.
Note the the makefile commands have to be executed at the root of the solution where Makefile file exists.
Build # make build This would internally trigger the dotnet build command against the ./src/Host/Host.csproj file.
Start API # make start This boots up the WebAPI at http://localhost:5001. Make sure that you have your API Connection strings configured before you run this command.</description></item><item><title>Project Structure</title><link>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/project-structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 09:17:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/project-structure/</guid><description>Genocs Library&amp;rsquo;s .NET WebApi Boilerplate is based on Clean Architecture.
